- **Workflows:** Use rules in `.cursor/rules/workflow-*.mdc` for feature, fix, refactor, review, or consult.
- **Skills:** Project skills in `.cursor/skills/` – pomodoro-extension, pomodoro-timer-logic, chrome-extension-testing – apply when working on extension code, timer/session logic, or testing.
