## Creating Icons

You can:

2. Use free icon generators online
3. Use emoji-based icons
4. Hire a designer

### Recommended Design

- Use a tomato (🍅) as the main symbol (representing Pomodoro)
- Use a clean, modern design with white background
- Ensure the icon is recognizable at all sizes

### Quick Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can use emoji-to-icon converters or screenshot emoji and resize them to the required dimensions.
